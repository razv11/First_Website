# Audi website

During the Erasmus mobility, I learned the basic concepts about HTML, CSS, Javascript and as a final project I had to build a web page using these technologies. Being
passionate about cars, I chose to make a web page about Audi, where I presented the main models made by this car brand and some general information about the company.

The website have 3 main html pages (home, models_audi, about) which are styled using CSS and can be accesed through a navingation bar situated on the top of the page.
