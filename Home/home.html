	<h3>Performance, intelligence and lightness</h3>
	<p>Design and technology are fused into one: A generous arc, the wraparound, envelops the cascading instrument panel with pronounced horizontal lines as far round as the sculptural
 	door trims. It harmoniously integrates the hood above the Audi virtual cockpit, whose sleek display stands visually free in space, as well as the displays of the optional virtual 
	exterior mirrors. The navigation system makes intelligent destination suggestions based on previous routes – so every appointment becomes a success.</p>

		<h5>Design</h5>
		<p>Design is about more than giving a shape to cars. It is part of a greater, more powerful idea. It is about people and their passions. Audi is pushing the boundaries of the 
		familiar design categories. Lighting, exterior and vehicle design are raised to new levels of inspiration and perfection. It demonstrates the power of stunning aesthetic innovation. Where 
		others offer pure functionality, Audi offers customers deep emotional impressions with fascinating details and a visionary touch.</p>

	<div class="vl"></div>
	<div class="content2">
		<h6>Performance</h6>
		<p>Performance is an integral part of Audi’s progressive attitude. It is deeply rooted in our DNA. Perfectionism in the development of high-performance vehicles and a responsible 
		handling of performance, power and speed also play a significant role. We set no limits on precision, efficiency, superior power and elegant design. For us, the will to constantly produce 
	 	better performance and to drive developments forward is paramount.</p>

	<h1>Our understanding of Vorsprung</h1>
	<p>Is it possible to fall in love with an aesthetic? This is the great power of design: it can create objects that touch us deeply with their brilliance. We love the dynamism and agility 
	of our cars yet, at the same time, we stand for a responsible and refined type of performance. Audi represents spiritual values above material wealth. In producing premium cars, we combine high 
	quality and perfection with accessibility and understatement. We dedicate our technologies to improving people’s lives, to making better progress in our complex world – through smart solutions 
	that work intuitively.</p>

		<h1>Sustainability</h1>
		<p>For Audi, sustainability is about having a value-oriented responsibility to the future. About a balance between economics, ecology and society. It means looking at the big picture.
 		Being transparent and acting with integrity are as much a part of this as taking a long-term and consistent view of things. For Audi, the future is an attitude: it’s about taking moral 
	 	responsibility and leading by example.</p>

		<h1>Digital</h1>
		<p>For us, digitalisation means making life easier and more convenient with the aid of digital formats. One of the main tasks here is to interconnect various formats and services 
		in a meaningful and seamless way. Our aim is to make the multitude of information from today’s digital world useful for customers and to integrate it fluently and almost imperceptibly into 
		their environment and daily lives. For us, ‘Vorsprung’ also means doing this with the greatest possible degree of individualisation and personalisation.</p>

	<div class="text8">* The specified fuel consumption and emission data have been determind according to the measurement procedures prescribed by law. Since 1st September 2017, 
		certain new vehicles are already being type-approved according to the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), a more realistic test procedure for measuring fuel 
		consumption and CO2 emissions. Starting on September 1st 2018, the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) will be replaced by the WLTP in stages. Owing to the more realistic test conditions, 
		the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions measured according to the WLTP will, in many cases, be higher than those measured according to the NEDC. Therefore, the usage of CO2 emission values 
		measured according to WLTP for vehicle taxation from 1st September 2018 on can cause changes in this regards as well. For further information on the differences between the WLTP and NEDC, 
		please visit <a href="https://www.audi.de/de/brand/de/neuwagen/layer/wltp-lp.html" style="color: grey;">www.audi.de/wltp.</a><br>
 	<br>
 		We are currently still required by law to state the NEDC figures. In the case of new vehicles which have been type-approved according to the WLTP, the NEDC figures are derived from the WLTP data.
 		It is possible to specify the WLTP figures voluntarily in addition until such time as this is required by law. In cases where the NEDC figures are specified as value ranges, these do not refer to a 
		particular individual vehicle and do not constitute part of the sales offering.<br>
 	<br>
		They are intended exclusively as a means of comparison between different vehicle types. Additional equipment and accessories (e.g. add-on parts, different tyre formats, etc.) may change 
		the relevant vehicle parameters, such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics, and, in conjunction with weather and traffic conditions and individual driving style, may affect fuel 
 		consumption, electrical power consumption, CO2 emissions and the performance figures for the vehicle.<br>
