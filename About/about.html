      <h>More than the sum of its parts: the team</h>
      <p>At the Audi Software Development Center, software developers, product managers and UX designers work as a vibrant and balanced team to ensure
         efficient and customer-focused software development. We combine the power of a small team with the resources of a large corporation. Find out 
          what you can expect as a new team member here:</p>

        <div class="details">

          <h>Product Manager</h>
          <p>Enabler, gatekeeper, organizer: Product managers transform the specialist department's product vision into concrete
             needs (user stories) for a new software product, while taking the customer perspective into account. They make sure
              that the developers always know what to do next so that they can then code freely.</p>

    <div id="more1">

      <b>Focus on customer benefits</b>
      <br><br>
      <b>Max, product manager</b>
      <br><br>
      <b>In the SDC, the product manager is a central part of the teams. How exactly do you see your role?</b><br>
      <b>Max:</b> We strive to ensure that the developers can work as distraction-free as possible. When the developers code, they focus for hours on programming 
          work and it's annoying for them when they get pulled out of it. It's one of our tasks to shield developers from such distractions.
      <br><br>
      <b>But that alone doesn't describe the product manager, does it?</b><br>
        Director or translator would be fitting. The product owners have the vision of the product and know exactly in which direction something should go.
         Most of the time, however, they don't speak the same language as the developers. I have a computer background and write many user stories myself. 
         I'm writing down the requirements of the product owners so that the developers can implement them. I don't provide a solution, but I'll describe in small 
         parts what's being developed, what's going to bring benefit to our customers, and how to prioritize development.
      <br><br>
      <b>There are many methods for how to organize work in a modern and efficient way. How do you work at the SDC?</b><br>
        To a large extent we work according to textbook, in our case this is extreme programming. In the lean environment, it is a matter of following methodologies 
        that are supposed to support you. But actually, they don't prescribe anything. There's a lot to adjust. But of course, you can’t start to 'cherry pick' here. 
        For example, we also do DevOps. Everything that is developed by us is also operated by us. Of course, this means that we also have to provide 24/7 support. 
        I can't just leave that out because I don't like it.
      <br><br>
      <b>In the SDC you work according to the model of pairing. How does this work in the case of product managers?</b><br>
        It's actually the first time I experience pairing. I didn't even know that in the product manager environment. It's sometimes exhausting because pairing 
        can be very demanding. With a little bit time to adapt, however, all this works very well. The speed with which we work is incomprehensible compared to normal methods. 
        A pleasant side effect is, for example, that last autumn I was on holiday for the first time in my career without a bad conscience. I was able to totally relax 
        because I knew that someone was taking care of the work. The downside, however, is that it can be quite exhausting at times. You are in a quasi-permanent meeting 
        with the pairing partner, which lasts the entire working day.

      <b>Teresa and Andrea, UX designers</b>
      <br><br>
      <b>Teresa and Andrea, you are UX designers at the Audi Software Development Center. Please describe what you do in the SDC. What is your role?</b>
      <br>
      <b>Teresa</b>: UX Design consists of the core elements of research and design. The combination is also known as product design. We research how we can best support 
        customers with solutions and represent the role of the user.
      <br><br>
      <b>Andrea</b>: We always take the first step in the project in the entire balanced team, consisting of product managers, developers and designers. Here we clarify 
        together what problems a digital product should solve and what added value it offers to the user.
      <br><br>
      <b>Teresa</b>: First of all, we work out our target group and start giving the product a face. For this we derive assumptions or hypotheses from the available sources. 
        These are then validated using individual interviews (“user tests”). Based on identified needs, the product is practically tailored to our customers.
      <br><br>
      <b>How do the interviews work in practice? What influence do the results have on the product?<br>
        Andrea:</b> We work agile according to the lean approach and thus receive prototypes very early on. We then test these with users in order to receive as much feedback 
        as possible in the shortest possible time. This quickly shows whether our assumptions or hypotheses also correspond to reality and whether the product is understood 
        by the user. The findings from the user tests flow directly into the product design and the prototype is continuously improved and further developed. The big advantage of this user-centered method: User testing is an important corrective that reduces the risk in the product development process to a minimum. This enables us to respond to changes flexibly, quickly and responsibly while ensuring simple, intuitive usability. Today, user research plays a crucial role in the development of successful digital products.
      <br><br>
      <b>What distinguishes the work in the SDC? What makes it so special for you?</b><br>
      <b>Andrea:</b> The nice thing about the SDC is that everyone can contribute and develop their own skills and strengths in the team. The SDC attaches great importance
        to further training, development of potential and diversity. This is also reflected in the culture. At the same time, we have the freedom to do things ourselves again, 
        to try them out, to learn and to decide. I am convinced that this is the right way to go if you want to continue to be innovative and competitive as a company. An open feedback and error culture is particularly important: In the SDC, we can make mistakes – the earlier the better. They are necessary to learn from them and to consistently improve.
      <br><br>
      <b>What skills does someone have to bring with them if they want to work with you?</b><br>
      <b>Teresa:</b> Teamwork is essential. Working in a team makes me faster, more efficient and better. We always work in pairs thanks to the "pairing" method. And this 
        second brain corrective is extremely important. As I said at the beginning, UX Design consists of research and design. I feel more at home in the research area. 
        Andrea is a communication designer. Through our collaboration, we bring both components in and learn from each other.
      <br><br>
      <b>Andrea:</b> This type of collaboration requires a corresponding mindset and skills such as openness, honesty, curiosity, empathy, courage and the drive to learn 
        new things. And one thing above all: serenity.

  <div class="text3">* The specified fuel consumption and emission data have been determind according to the measurement procedures prescribed by law. Since 1st September 2017, certain new vehicles are already being type-approved according to the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), a more realistic test procedure for measuring fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Starting on September 1st 2018, the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) will be replaced by the WLTP in stages. Owing to the more realistic test conditions, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions measured according to the WLTP will, in many cases, be higher than those measured according to the NEDC. Therefore, the usage of CO2 emission values measured according to WLTP for vehicle taxation from 1st September 2018 on can cause changes in this regards as well. For further information on the differences between the WLTP and NEDC, please visit <a href="https://www.audi.de/de/brand/de/neuwagen/layer/wltp-lp.htm"style="color: grey;">www.audi.de/wltp.</a><br>
    <br>
    We are currently still required by law to state the NEDC figures. In the case of new vehicles which have been type-approved according to the WLTP, the NEDC figures are derived from the WLTP data. It is possible to specify the WLTP figures voluntarily in addition until such time as this is required by law. In cases where the NEDC figures are specified as value ranges, these do not refer to a particular individual vehicle and do not constitute part of the sales offering.<br>
    <br>
   They are intended exclusively as a means of comparison between different vehicle types. Additional equipment and accessories (e.g. add-on parts, different tyre formats, etc.) may change the relevant vehicle parameters, such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics, and, in conjunction with weather and traffic conditions and individual driving style, may affect fuel consumption, electrical power consumption, CO2 emissions and the performance figures for the vehicle.<br>
